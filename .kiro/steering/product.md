# Product Overview

Lumimenta is a physical photography art project that creates scarce, tangible trading card prints. The project explores the return to physical artifacts in the digital age.

## Core Concept

- Photographs are printed on demand using Kodak C210R and never stored digitally
- Each card is hand-annotated with metallic ink (blue, silver, or gold) indicating rarity
- Cards are timestamped with Bitcoin block height for decentralized, immutable timestamps
- Physical cards are the primary artifacts; digital images are only documentation

## Rarity System

- **Blue**: Most common, standard edition
- **Silver**: Rare, limited edition  
- **Gold**: Rarest, one-of-a-kind

## Philosophy

The project inverts the typical digital-first photography model. Physical cards are originals; online images are merely evidence of their existence. This creates scarcity and tangibility in an age of infinite digital reproduction.

## Distribution

Documentation photographs are shared on Nostr (decentralized social protocol), aligning with the project's use of Bitcoin block height timestamps and decentralized philosophy.
