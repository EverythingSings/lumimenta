            <p>Lumimenta is a photography series exploring the return to physical artifacts in an increasingly digital world. Each photograph is printed on demand using a Kodak C210R, creating scarce, tangible cards that can never exist digitally—only as physical objects.</p>
            
            <p>Inspired by trading cards, each print is annotated with colored metallic ink (blue, silver, or gold), my signature, edition number (1/2, 2/2, 1/1, etc.), and the Bitcoin block height as a rough timestamp—anchoring each piece to a specific moment in blockchain time.</p>
            
            <p>The photographs themselves are never stored as digital files. Once printed, they exist only as physical artifacts—scarce, tradeable, and deliberately offline.</p>

        <section class="philosophy" aria-label="Philosophy statement">
            <p>"In an age where everything is copied infinitely, where every image lives as data in the cloud, Lumimenta asks: what if we returned to the scarce, the tangible, the real?"</p>
            <br>
            <p>"These are not photographs of things. They are things—physical artifacts that cannot be replicated, only documented."</p>

            <p>Documentation photographs of physical cards. Each image represents tangible artifacts that exist only as physical prints.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="timestamping-heading">
            <h2 id="timestamping-heading">TIMESTAMPING</h2>
            <p>Each card is marked with the current Bitcoin block height at the time of printing. Block height serves as a decentralized, immutable timestamp—a way to anchor each physical artifact to a specific moment without relying on traditional dates or centralized systems.</p>
            
            <p>The blockchain provides proof of when that moment existed, creating a bridge between the physical and the crypto-native—a decentralized, immutable record that anyone can verify.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="documentation-heading">
            <h2 id="documentation-heading">DOCUMENTATION & NOSTR</h2>
            <p>Documentation photographs are shared on Nostr, a decentralized social protocol. This platform alignment is deliberate—Nostr's censorship-resistant, decentralized architecture mirrors the philosophical approach of using Bitcoin block height as a timestamp.</p>
            
            <p>The photographs you see online are not the artwork—they are documentation of the artwork. The actual pieces exist only as physical cards, held by collectors. This inverts the typical relationship between digital and physical in contemporary photography.</p>
            
            <p>While these digital photographs allow the work to be cataloged and the cards to be traded, they deliberately maintain a hierarchy: the physical card is the original, the primary artifact. The digital image is merely evidence of its existence.</p>
